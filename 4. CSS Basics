    under the title, add <link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='CSS Basics.css'>
    add some attributes: h1{color: orange}
    
3. Colors in CSS:
    The color uses Hexadecimal System base 16
    0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F
    _ _ first two decides hwo much red
    _ _ middle two decides how much green
    _ _ last two decides how much blue
    
    RGB system:
    color: rgb(_ _ _, _ _ _, _ _ _) base 10
    Largest is 255
    
    RGBA:
    color: rgba(_, _, _, _) 255,255,255,0-1
    the forth one is transparent

4. BackGround
    In CSS and single label like h2, add background: rgb() to add color;
    In body, add background url(image address) no-repeat;
                background-size: cover;        
    # to ask the image not repeat and only one cover the whole page.

    border-color: purple;
    border-width: 5px;
    border-style: solid;
    OR
    border: 8px dashed rgb();

    id: just for one element, select one.And use #id to call it 
    class: similar to id, but can select many as you want and use .class to call it
    element selector EX: li{}
    Star selector: *{}
    Descendent selector: ul li a{} 
    Adjacent : h4 + ul {}
    Attribute Selector: a[href="http://www.google.com"]{ color: blue}
                        input[typr="checkbox"]{}
    N th of types: ul:nth-of-type(3){}
